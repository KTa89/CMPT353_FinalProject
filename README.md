# CMPT 353 Final Project: Smartphone Data Analysis

## Purpose

This project analyzes smartphone data to explore and answer the following questions:

- **Q1:** Explore what is measured under smartphone ratings. Try to find out if there is a correlation between price, tech specifications, and user ratings. We can use correlation analysis or linear regression for this.
- **Q2:** Does 5G affect smartphone prices? Analyze the adoption rate of 5G technology in smartphones over price segments.
- **Q3:** Analyze the smartphone market distribution by brand, price segments, and key features. Which brand produces the most expensive smartphones on average? What is the average rating per brand?
- **Q4:** Develop a model that predicts the price of a smartphone based on its specifications.
- **Q5:** What is the average lifespan of smartphones based on their specifications?
